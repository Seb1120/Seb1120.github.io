	<h1>Overview of Project and Progress</h1>
	<pre>
	This project was the brain child of me and my roommate Thomas. Early in the fall semester of 2019, I bought a small full suspension
	mountain bike from a local used bike shop. I bought it mainly for getting to and from campus without relying on busses, but when I saw 
	it in the shop I thought back to when me and Thomas had the idea of doing a two wheel drive ebike conversion, and it seemed like it would
	be a good base for it. It came with disc brakes which is a must for anything motorized and in Colorado, and the full suspension would make 
	for a more comfortable ride, which considering road conditions on my commute to campus, was a welcome feature.
